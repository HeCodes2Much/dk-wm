### yaxwm
Yet Another X Window Manager

It's no secret that there are too many window managers in the linux world.. Here's another.

A large portions of the code are based or pulled directly from dwm so most behavior is the same *(for now)*.
While while there are no set limitations for what yax is to achieve, I appreciate the suckless approach.

In terms of features yax takes a more standard approach to virtual desktops,
this will help with incorporating external programs *(status bars and the like)*

#### Installation
Run `make clean install` *(as root if needed)*.

#### Usage
To start yaxwm you can add `exec yaxwm` to your xinitrc.

#### Configuration
Edit the source and recompile.
